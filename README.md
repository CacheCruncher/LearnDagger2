Dagger 2
- Components: A component gives you the things your app needs (objects).

- Modules: A module shows the component how to make those things (objects).

- Injection: Injection is how Dagger automatically puts those things (objects) where they’re needed in your app.

- Qualifier: A qualifier helps you pick between different options when there are multiple choices for something.

- Scope: Scope defines how long something lives—like if it’s only needed for an activity or the whole app.

- Factory: A factory creates components with different settings when you need them.

- Builder: A builder lets you customize and build components step-by-step.
